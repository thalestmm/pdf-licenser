# PDF License Writer

This script aims to be added to any other project (mostly WebDev) on which you'll distribute some sort of `.pdf` proprietary material (e-books, etc.).

In order to dissuade malicious distribution of said material, you'll now be able to easily add the client's personal information to it, both in the form of actual written text on each page and as hidden metadata.

Yes, I know this is not a failproof approach. Other options include adding some watermark to every page as well, but I'm not particularly fond of such idea, as it degrades the reading process.
